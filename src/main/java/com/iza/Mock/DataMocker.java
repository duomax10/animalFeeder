 * Created by anelson on 3/17/2016.
 * There is WAYYYYY too much to even get a functional web service stubbed out we need
 * Create zoos
 * Create feeds
 * Create species
 * Create animals
 * Create some data so the endpoints are meaningful
 *
 * We could create SQL scripts that do all of these, but I don't know if I'll even have time to
 * create the schema and wire it up through JPA, so, we're going to cheat and make some data
